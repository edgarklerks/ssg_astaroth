# The names of Astaroth

Astaroth has a long history and is likely part of humanity and perhaps older than us. She has as much names as the wind 
and frankly it is unknowable to get them all. However I found a couple, which may help the beginning practioner. 

Often a different name refers to a different [[03_masks]] to her, this is only a part of her relative to a culture and a specific period of time. 

## Bible 

Astaroth appeared first as a duke of hell in the renaissance style grimoires. When evoked however she often came as female goddesss. 
The Astaroth is derived from Astoreth in the bible in the old testament [Judges 3:7](https://www.christianity.com/bible/esv/judges/3-7). 
Here the people of Israel are said to have forgotten Yahwew and started to serve the Baals and Asteroth. 
Asteroth refers to multiple goddesses from that time. 

This later become Astaroth as we known from the Lemegton and for example the black dragon grimoire. 

Astaroth however comes from Astarte, a hellinized form of the middle eastern goddess Attart. 

## Semitic origin

Attart was equivalent to the goddess Ishtar and hence people often claim that Astaroth is the same as Ishtar. 
While this is partially true, it is a bit more complicated due to the masks she wears. 

Astarte was worshipped during the bronze age (at least 1200BC) up to the classical antiquity period (e.g  old Greece).   

As Astarte she was widely known and worshipped. Not only in ancient Greece but also the Canaanites and by the Phoenicians.

## Greece period 

Back to a bit later in history. In Greece she became Aphrodite, who suprisingly to many has strong war like epithets. See the battle of Troje for example. But also as Eris the goddess of strife, Artemis under the epithet: Astrateia. 

The cult of Aphrodite was strongly influenced by Astarte. Aphrodite even has an epithet called Heavenly (Ourania), which resonates with queen of Heaven. The spartans worshipped her as Enoplios, which means armed and shows one of her more war like aspects and also as Areia, which means warlike.  

When invoke her under such epiteths, you can work with different aspects of her. 

## Egypt

If we move down on the world map, we encounter Egypt. Here we find the goddess Isis. The case of Isis is a bit more interesting. She replaced Hathor and fused with Astarte. Personally I believe both goddess were different, 
but nowadays they refer to the same being. 

## Mespotamia

And finally we arive at Mesopotamia. Here the goddess Ishtar was worshipped. We have already seen that the goddess Attart was linked to Ishtar and therefore there is a link between Astarte and Ishtar. 
These goddesses feel mostly the same when invoked.    
And Ishtar came from Inanna. 

Inanna is the oldest known name of the goddess. She originally came from the city of Uruk around 4000BC and initially in three forms: 

* Morning Inanna (Innana hud)
* Evening Inanna (Innana sig)
* Princely Inanna (Inanna NUN)

Before the conquest of Sargon of Akkad, worship was local to Uruk. After the conquest, she began to spread over whole Mesopotamia.

## Afterword 

There are many more links and paths in history. I would like to invite the reader to learn the various names and read about the history of the feminine divine during history.
